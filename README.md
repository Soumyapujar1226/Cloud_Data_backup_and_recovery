## Deletion of Files

Due to authentication issues, we had to delete two files from the repository. These files were removed to ensure the repository is properly secured and to resolve any potential access conflicts.

The following files were deleted:
-
- 'serviceAccountKey.json' (This file contained sensitive authentication credentials that, if exposed, could pose a security risk. It was deleted to ensure the repository remains secure and prevent unauthorized access.)
- 'firebase.js' (This file likely contained configuration information related to Firebase, which could also include sensitive data such as API keys or other security-related settings. It was removed to mitigate the risk of exposing such information and to address any potential access conflicts.)

We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding.
